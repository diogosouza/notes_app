# notes_app

Task Management Application created with [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) and [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/), Babel, Bower, HTML5 and jQuery.

To start the app, make sure you have [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as well as `grunt-cli` properly installed:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    
So, inside the root folder, run the command:

    grunt build
    
This is going to generate a `/dist` folder where it's placed the `index.html` page.
